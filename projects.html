			  <li class="style5"><span class="style6"><strong>ABSTRACT</strong>: With the advent of increased computing on mobile devices such as phones and tablets, it has become crucial to pay attention to the energy consumption of mobile applications. The software engineering field is now faced with a whole new spectrum of energy-related challenges, ranging from power budgeting to testing and debugging the energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge there has been little work on the analysis of energy patterns. In this paper, we present our work for the Windows Phone platform. We first describe the data that is collected for testing (power traces and execution logs). We then present several approaches for describing power consumption and detecting anomalous energy patterns and poten-tial energy defects. Finally, we describe prediction models to estimate the overall energy consumption based on usage of individual modules. This allows assessing the individual impact of modules on the overall energy consumption and supports overall energy planning. </span></li>

			    <li class="style5"><span class="style6"><strong>ABSTRACT</strong>: Itemset mining has been an active area of research due to its successful application in various data mining scenarios including ﬁnding association rules. Though most of the past work has been on ﬁnding frequent itemsets, infrequent itemset mining has demonstrated its utility in web mining, bioinformatics and other ﬁelds. In this  aper, we propose a new algorithm based on the pattern-growth paradigm to ﬁnd minimally infrequent itemsets. A minimally infrequent itemset has no subset which is also infrequent. We also introduce the novel concept of residual trees. We further utilize the residual trees to mine multiple level minimum support itemsets where different thresholds are used for ﬁnding frequent itemsets for different lengths of the itemset. Finally, we analyze the behavior of our algorithm with respect to different parameters and show through experiments that it outperforms the competing ones.</span></li>

A semantic network with nodes and relations was retrieved for query keywords using WordNet and MNEX. A semantic bag of words was generated, which was used to re-rank the sentences along with the semantic network. Implementation was done in Java on top of an existing award-winning IIIT-H summarization system. The system achieved better correlation scores to manually ranked sentences as compared to the existing systems.

			  <li class="style5"><span class="style6"><strong>ABSTRACT</strong>: In this paper, we present the prototype of an automated education system, aimed at helping the students in their learning process. Our main motivation is to introduce a dynamic component in such learning systems as compared to existing systems which are primarily static in nature. We aim to automatically solve problems, in the domain of Periodic Table and its properties, with proper logic and reasoning, generate solutions and explanations in accordance with the interest and knowledge of the student. The project involves formulation of a logical system for the Periodic Table in Prolog with an interface in Yield Prolog. The system instead of being based on direct lookup paradigm, breaks a complex problem into certain basic facts by relating it to the underlying logic and provides a smooth ﬂow of reasoning from the base argument up to the ﬁnal solution. We aim to convert it to interactive system where the student can ask for preferential solution taking into account the knowledge base of a speciﬁc individual. The project’s main features include logic formulation, problem solving in logic, hint generation and problem generation. We present a statistical evaluation showing that the system solves a large number of questions for each template that is created.</span></li>

			  <li class="style5"><span class="style6"><strong>ABSTRACT</strong>: In this work, we address the issue of retrieving coherent chains between given two news articles. We devise a modiﬁed version of Dijkstra Algorithm for ﬁnding the shortest path between two document, keeping in mind the coherent nature of the chain and not just the pairwise coherency. We adapt a similarity measure based on the correlation of documents through words. We also test our algorithm with other standard similarity measure. We propose two promising approaches which can extended further: using Semantic similarity alongwith Earth Movers and using Kullback Leibler divergence on topic distribution of the documents. We evaluate our techniques by soliciting users and taking feedback. We also devise an evaluation metric which captures the amount of incorrect articles given with respect to a manually generated link chain.</span></li>
